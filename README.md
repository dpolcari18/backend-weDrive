## weDrive - Backend

weDrive is a journey management application that aims to reduce the risks associated with driving by providing the user with the information necessary to make smart driving decisions before they get in their car.

## Motivation

Driving is the most dangerous thing most people do on a daily basis but it's also something we take for granted and don't pay it the respect it deserves. weDrive was created to help encourage users to really think about the factors that impact their safety before they get in the car so they can plan accordingly and hopefully reduce the risk of an accident.
